 Nonlinear Phenomena in Complex Systems (NPCS) is a quarterly journal, which publishes original research papers and reviews.

Our primary goal is to provide a single forum  to strengthen links between basic and applied research, theoretical and experimental methods relating to nonlinear dynamics of complex systems in the natural and social sciences. We also aim to bring together high-quality papers on all aspects of nonlinear dynamics, including phenomena, modelling, and complexity. 

We provide timely dissemination and mutual development of new ideas, principles, and techniques across the interdisciplinary front.

Areas this journal includes are: 
* experiments;
* computational and theoretical aspects of phase transitions;
* critical phenomena;
* self-organization, bifurcations, chaos;
* fluctuation phenomena;
* pattern formation;
* fractals and complexity in physics, mathematics, chemistry, engineering, biology, social and economic sciences;
* other areas of Scientific efforts.

The first issue was published in December, 1998, and now the journal achieved a respectable scientific quality. Papers published in NPCS are continuously quoted in other high-rated international journals. Since 2011 the NPCS Journal is included into the Scopus system. 

We invite authors to submit their papers on any topic covered by the journal.
